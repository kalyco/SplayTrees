# SplayTrees

## Build a splay tree for a theoretical music search algorithm but implementing a log(n) search

## Supported operations:  

* Insert a new musician (and song associated with that node). If musician already exists, add the song to the list of songs associated with the musician

* Delete a musician

* Search for a musician. If the musician exists, return the exact match. Otherwise return the closest result

* Output the playlist of songs in the sorted order of musicians

* The intermediate splay trees are dumbed in the (GraphViz)[https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html] format to help visualize balancing operations.
